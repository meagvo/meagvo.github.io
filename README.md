### About Me
I’m a Data Scientist with experience in Tableau, SQL, Python, PowerBI, and other custom BI software. I excel in data visualization and in-depth analyses using both descriptive statistics and predictive models. In addition, I have a strong track record in perfecting statistical analyses for dissertations and Master’s theses using SPSS. As I’ve done this, I’ve grown to love data science and data analytics. I completed a data science certification through Springboard in 2020, where I gained further skills in tools such as Python, R, and SQL. I completed two end-to-end data science capstone projects. 

Currently, I'm working as a data scientist at a healthcare company. my day-to-day tasks include managing dashboards, running patient segmentation models, and risk stratification models. I'm also a peer mentor at Springboard for the data science career track - I'll be transitioning to a formal mentor role this month.

### Featured Projects

- [Dunkin Donuts SEO](https://github.com/meagvo/DunkinDonutsSEOproject): Third capstone for Springboard data science career track focused on an SEO business problem related to Dunkin Donuts. A predictive model will be developed using training data to predict the keywords that have the potential to drive the most traffic to the website. These keywords will then be focused on for a comprehensive SEO program for the next six months.
