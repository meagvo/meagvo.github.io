### About Me
I’m a Data Scientist with experience in Tableau, SQL, Python, PowerBI, and other custom BI software. I excel in data visualization and in-depth analyses using both descriptive statistics and predictive models. In addition, I have a strong track record in perfecting statistical analyses for dissertations and Master’s theses using SPSS. As I’ve done this, I’ve grown to love data science and data analytics. I completed a data science certification through Springboard in 2020, where I gained further skills in tools such as Python, R, and SQL. I completed two end-to-end data science capstone projects. 

Currently, I'm working as a data scientist at a healthcare company. my day-to-day tasks include managing dashboards, running patient segmentation models, and risk stratification models. I'm also a peer mentor at Springboard for the data science career track - I'll be transitioning to a formal mentor role this month.
