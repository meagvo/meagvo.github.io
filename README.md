### About Me
I’m a Data Scientist with experience in Tableau, SQL, Python, PowerBI and other custom BI software. I excel in data visualization and in-depth analyses using both descriptive statistics and predictive models. In addition, I have a strong track record in perfecting the statistical analyses for dissertations and Master’s theses using SPSS. As I’ve done this, I’ve grown to love data science and data analytics. In 2020, I completed a data science certification through Springboard, where I gained further skills in tools such as Python, R, and SQL. I completed two end-to-end data science capstone projects. 

I graduated from Farmingdale State College with a BS in Applied Psychology in 2015. Throughout my time there, I focused on Industrial/Organizational psychology. I learned the basics of SPSS for business, completed an independent research project on test anxiety interventions for college students, and became a research assistant. 

After graduating from Farmingdale State College, I moved on to Stony Brook University to earn my master's degree in psychology, with a concentration in integrative neuroscience. I dug into statistics for psychology and mastered SPSS for research. On the side, I served as a quantitative analyst, performing the SPSS analyses for students' dissertations and writing up the results in APA format.

I'm currently working at a healthcare company as a data scientist. On the side, I do freelance writing and SEO analytics projects.
